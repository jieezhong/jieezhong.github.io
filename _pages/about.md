I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Economics Department at Texas A&M University.

I am interested in studying public policies’ short and long-term impacts and how they impact inequality. My current work studies public policies’ impacts on education, health, and labor market outcomes, especially for disadvantaged populations.

I am on the Job Market for the 2022-2023 academic year.

Research Areas: education economics, environmental economics, health economics, and crime economics.
