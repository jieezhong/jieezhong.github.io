***[Can Social Media Rhetoric Incite Hate Incidents? Evidence from Trump's "Chinese Virus" Tweets](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094119023000608)***

 <ins>Journal of Urban Economics, 2023</ins>. Corresponding Author, Joint with Andy Cao and Jason M. Lindo. 

> Abstract: We investigate whether Donald Trump's "Chinese Virus" tweets contributed to the rise of anti-Asian incidents. We find that the number of incidents spiked following Trump's initial “Chinese Virus” tweets and the subsequent dramatic rise in internet search activity for the phrase. Difference-in-differences and event-study analyses leveraging spatial variation indicate that this spike in anti-Asian incidents was significantly more pronounced in counties that supported Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election relative to those that supported Hillary Clinton. We estimate that anti-Asian incidents spiked by approximately 4200% in Trump-supported counties compared to an increase of approximately 200% in Clinton-supported counties.

***[Early Grade Retention Harms Adult Earnings](/files/pdf/JMP.pdf)***

Conditional acceptance at the <ins> American Economic Journal: Applied Economics </ins>

> Abstract: This paper presents the first causal evidence of the effects of grade retention on labor market outcomes and post-secondary educational attainment, analyzing a reading test-based retention policy in Texas. Employing a fuzzy regression discontinuity design, the study finds that third-grade retention significantly reduces the average earnings between ages 23 and 25 by $3,512 (22%). While retention initially increases test scores, these gains diminish over time. Moreover, retention increases school absence, violence, and crime. It further reduces the likelihood of high school graduation but does not affect college enrollment, graduation, the timing of these outcomes, or the selectivity of college attended.

***Lead in the Air: New Evidence from Piston-Engine Aircraft Emissions*** (Joint with Thao Duong)

> Abstract: Does lead pollution from piston engine aircraft (PEA) pose risks to children’s development? This paper provides the first causal evidence on the impact of lead emissions from PEA on both short- and long-term educational and labor market outcomes. We implement a difference-in-differences strategy that leverages a sharp increase in PEA activity in Texas after 2007 and cross-school variation in proximity to lead exposure. Our results indicate that an increase of 80,000 PEA flights leads to a 0.03 standard deviation decline in standardized test scores and a 0.07 percentage point reduction in school attendance. In contrast, we find no statistically significant effects on high school graduation, college enrollment, or early-career earnings.
